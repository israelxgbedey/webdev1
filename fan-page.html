            <h3>My Fashion Icon&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>Playboi Carti is late to his shoot at an apartment complex on 139th Street in Harlem. Here, the 21-year-old rapper has a gang of publicists waiting for him, while a crew of Grailed employees organizes piles of clothes for him to try on. Carti loves the site Grailed, which is like a virtual candy store for those with a taste for Raf Simons and Balmain. “I’ve always been a thrift store kid,” he later tells me. But these clothes are far from humble thrift store finds: A stylist has draped a $20,000 fur coat and a bevy of other haute goods over the couch. Eventually, he arrives, making a much-awaited entrance in a new pair of sneakers.</p>

            <h3>Favorite Designer&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>If you are fine-tuned to the fashion-world power rankings, you already know that we’re living in the Rick Owens era. And even if you’re not, you’ve probably caught wind of his cinematic fashion shows, his arresting alien models, or at least this photo of him riding a Lime scooter in Paris. In the 18 years that Owens has put on runway collections, first in New York and since 2003 in Paris, the designer has risen from a fringe eccentric to one of fashion’s most essential, provocative, and inspiring voices. As he tells it, part of his success is down to the fact that fashion is ruthless, wiping out most of his independently owned peers and putting the conglomerates, with their revolving doors of creative directors, on shaky footing. He’s just about the last man standing—and he’s standing tall in 6.5-inch platform boots.</p>

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Today everyone knows what punk fashion is, but in 1970 it didn’t exist. Punk first emerged in the mid-1970s in London as an anarchic and aggressive movement. About 200 young people defined themselves as an anti-fashion urban youth street culture. Closely aligned was a music movement that took the name punk.</p>
