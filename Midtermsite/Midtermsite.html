              <h1>Application Description</h1>
              <h5>Introduction </h5>
				<p>A lot of people told me that they often need things done but don’t really know who to ask or sometimes just don’t have the money to pay someone to do it. Not everybody has money but everybody or at least most people know how to do something so instead of paying for services peoples could trade services. The app would the called “Work for it”. 
				</p>
				<h5>The target audience </h5>
                <p>The target audience would primarily be college students. If you need your computer fixed and someone that knows how to needs a babysitter, you could do that in return for their service. </p>
				<h5> platform/format </h5>
              	<p>The application would be available online so it’s easily accessible from any web browser. It would also be available as a standalone app on both android and IOS. For the web version I would use adobe’s Dreamweaver because it supports html, CSS and JavaScript, it also allows you to see your work rendered in real time. For the IOS app I would use XCode and Swift Ui because they are the best option for IOS and Mac OS development and finally for the android version I would use Android Studio and SDK tools because it’s provided directly by Google and it’s also open source.
