    <h3>leather jacket</h3>
    
<div class="item-content">
	
   
    <p> A leather jacket can go with most of the pants. For a casual daily wearing denim or chinos are best to pair with a leather jacket. Black, blue, and brown pants are common these days wearing with the leather jacket.</p>

    <h3>Black Jean</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>Opting for classic blue is never a bad idea, but black’s a traditional closet staple. There’s a reason why most of us reach for our charcoal pair. It’s safe, straightforward, and relatively easy to style. Plus, our go-to black jean is considered a more ‘dressed-up version’ than the lax set of sweats. </p>

    <h3> Spiked choker</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>The studded or spiked choker must be worn fairly tightly (make sure you can still breathe and swallow comfortably, of course) and with a top which shows it off. I tried it with a shirt beforehand but the collar was too close to the choker and the edgy effect was lost.</p>

    <h3>Silver ring</h3>

      <p>As punk fashion becomes more popular, many want to participate in the trend but don’t know-how. Wearing silver rings is one way to look fantastic and outfit yourself for the punk style.</p>

    <h3>Chuncky boots</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>It's officially boot season, which means it's time to break them out and start planning winter outfits that will keep you looking stylish throughout the season. If you're wondering why chunky boots are taking over the shoe trend this season, look no further. Let me tell you, they instantly give you an edgy look, and they are super comfortable.</p>

    <h3>Rick Owens </h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>wens made the ever-popular over-the-knee-boot cool long before fashion girls started sporting the style. Influenced by his post-apocalyptic rock 'n' roll style, Owens' signature sky-high platform Kiss boot—with variations including chunky, lucite heels and grills—are unique not only in their design but their gender-breaking intentions, seen on the likes of Luka Sabbat and fashion duo Fecal Matter.</p>

    <h3>Leather pants</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>According to Ned’s Declassified fashion survival guide, leather pants are what separates trendsetters from casual dressers. Sultry, slim, and built for femme fatales, there’s no better feeling than donning a pair of jet-black skinnies. </p>

    <h3>Motorcycle/jacket</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>Though the punk era of the 1970s may have reinvented the way the public perceived the leather jacket, its history runs much deeper. In 1928, designer Irving Schott developed the very first leather motorcycle jacket for Harley Davidson. Schott’s expertise was later called upon once again during WWII to design what we now know as the bomber jacket.</p>
