    <h3>Baggy jeans </h3>
    
<div class="item-content">
	
    <p>If you're unbothered by bold silhouettes and/or strictly clothe your body in ubercomfy clothing, baggy jeans are undoubtedly a look to try..</p>
	
    <p> With so much nostalgic '90s fashion continuing to trend in 2021, from the triumphant return of the tube top to cardigans and chunky footwear, from sandals to platforms, it's no surprise that baggy jeans are in the mix as a right-now staple</p>

    <h3>Vintage Tee</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>Part of what makes these T-shirts so appealing is the "vintage" look to the outfit. If you're a vintage T-shirt fan (or any kind of vintage), just stay authentic. Shop originals where you can and whatever you style it with, make sure it feels like "you". Wear it with the high-waisted jeans you've had for years, or your favourite go-to coat. </p>

    <h3>Swing coat</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>One item of clothing that is the definition of vintage is the swing coat. This type of coat is more fitted at the shoulders and gets progressively looser all the way to the hem. As you walk, it makes a swinging motion which is how it came upon it’s name. It was a style that was very prominent in the 1950s and it was originally designed to accommodate a full skirt underneath.</p>
