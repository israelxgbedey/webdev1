    <h3>Baggy jeans </h3>
<div class="item-content">
    <p>This baggier denim trend gives hints to that skater-girl vibe when paired with Vans and oversize striped tees, but as Seidel said, when juxtaposed with a tiny bag, kitten heels, and maybe even some pearls, this casual denim trend can instantly read elegant and forward. But don't be mistaken—this look is taken straight from the late '90s skater kids we all secretly wanted to be, but the style is officially back and it's better.</p>

    <h3>Bomber jacket</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>First of all, it should be an oversized bomber jacket – it can be slightly oversized or even very oversized, borrow one from your boyfriend, brother, father or some other guy, it will be perfect. It shouldn’t be fitting or too fitting – this isn’t comfy and isn’t in trend..</p>

    <h3>Dangly earings</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>Dangle earrings have found their way from celebs and models to men in the office and boys next door. I mean, just go on TikTok and check out some eboys. The past year has only given the dangle earring look for men a grander platform. Now, this look has moved past the world of glamorous high-fashion and into the less-glamorous world of real life. That being said, the dangle look seems that it’s here to stay.</p>

    <h3>Bucket hat</h3>
    <div class="item-content">
      <p>90s fashion has been coming back big time over the last year or so. Alongside all the plaid and wide-fitting denim is another, equally polarizing item: bucket hats. This loosely structured headwear is ideal for a chilled out casual summer outfit and fits in perfectly with the relaxed vibe that is dominating menswear at the moment.</p>
